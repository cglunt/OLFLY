Add a new feature to Olfly that rewards users with monthly streak and intensity improvement achievements and allows them to share these achievements on social media as an image card, similar to language learning apps.

1. Achievement System

Implement an achievement engine that evaluates user data daily and unlocks achievements.

Inputs:

Completed sessions by date

Intensity ratings per scent by date

Create achievements:
A) Streak achievements:

3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 day streak

B) Improvement achievements:

First improvement: any scent increases by +1 compared to prior 7 day average

Monthly improvement: percentage increase in average intensity over last 30 days compared to previous 30 days

Personal best: highest average intensity in a 7 day window

Each achievement should include:

id

title

description

category (streak or improvement)

unlockedAt timestamp

shareTemplateType (streak, improvement, milestone)

Store unlocked achievements in local storage:

olflyAchievements

2. UI: Progress Screen Updates

Add a new section on Progress screen:

Title: “Achievements”

Grid of unlocked badges

Locked badges shown as muted silhouettes with “Next up” label

When a new achievement unlocks:

Show a celebration modal

Confetti animation optional

Buttons:

“Share”

“Not now”

3. Share Card Generator

Create a “Share Card” component that renders a square social image (1080x1080).

Design requirements:

Deep purple background #1A0F35

Flat UI cards #2B215B

Accent gradient #DF37FF to #A259FF

Bold headline

Include badge icon

Include user stats

Include small Olfly logo with “OLF” emphasized

Add discreet footer: “Olfly • Wake up your super sniffer”

Create at least 3 templates:

Streak template

Improvement template with sparkline chart

Milestone template

4. Export and Share Functionality

Add functionality to export the share card as an image and trigger share options.

Implementation approach:

Render the share card in an offscreen container

Use html-to-image or similar library to generate PNG

Provide options:

“Download image”

“Copy image”

“Share” using Web Share API if supported
If Web Share API not available:

fallback to download

5. Data Calculations

Streak logic:

A streak is consecutive days with at least one completed session

Monthly improvement logic:

Compute average intensity for last 30 days

Compute average intensity for previous 30 days

Calculate percent change

If no prior data, show “New baseline month” badge instead

Sparkline:

Use a simple mini line chart based on last 30 days of average intensity

6. Microcopy and Tone

Use friendly language:

“Your nose is leveling up.”

“Consistency pays off.”

“Slow progress is still progress.”

7. Placement in App

Add a “Share progress” button on:

Achievement modal

Progress screen

Session summary screen (if streak or improvement changed)

8. Deliverables

Achievement engine

Progress screen achievements section

Achievement unlock modal

Share card templates

Export to PNG

Share options with fallbacks

Suggested Badge Naming (Fits Olfly Tone)

You can use these immediately:

Streak

“Warm Up” (3 days)

“Getting Serious” (7 days)

“Habit Locked” (14 days)

“Super Sniffer” (30 days)

“Nose Ninja” (60 days)

“Scent Sensei” (90 days)

Improvement

“First Spark”

“Smell Signal Rising”

“New Personal Best”

“Progress You Can Feel”

Quick UX Tip

Do not over-celebrate tiny gains. Celebrate:

streaks

month over month improvement

new personal bests
That keeps it meaningful and avoids spammy vibes.
