The primary recommended approach to restoring the sense of smell after COVID-19 is olfactory (smell) training, which is a simple, at-home exercise. Other potential treatments and safety precautions are also relevant. 
Primary Recommendation: Olfactory Training
Smell training is widely recommended by medical professionals and has the best evidence of success. It works by stimulating nerve pathways and encouraging the regeneration of olfactory neurons, similar to physical therapy for muscles. 
Scents Used: The standard set of four scents includes rose (floral), lemon/citrus (fruity), clove/cinnamon (spicy), and eucalyptus (resinous/menthol).
Routine: The training should be performed twice daily for several months. Consistency and patience are crucial for results.
Technique:
Place a few drops of an essential oil on a cotton ball or pad, or use the raw material (e.g., ground coffee, an orange peel).
Bring the pad within an inch of your nose and take slow, natural sniffs for about 15-20 seconds. Avoid aggressive sniffing.
As you sniff, actively try to recall the smell and form a mental connection or memory of it.
Take a short break (about 10 seconds) and repeat with the next scent.
After about 3 months, it can be beneficial to switch to a new set of scents to provide varied stimulation. 
Other Potential Treatments
While smell training is the gold standard, some other treatments are being explored or used in specific clinical contexts, though none are universally approved: 
Nasal Steroid Sprays: Over-the-counter nasal corticosteroid sprays may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages, although their effectiveness for COVID-19-related anosmia is considered limited or not consistently significant in large trials.
Supplements: Some doctors suggest supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, alpha-lipoic acid, or vitamin A due to their anti-inflammatory and restorative properties, but robust scientific evidence is limited.
Emerging/Experimental Treatments: More invasive and experimental treatments, such as Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections or stellate ganglion blocks, are being investigated in clinical trials and have shown some promise, but are not yet mainstream recommendations.
Medications: Early intervention with the antiviral Paxlovid may decrease the risk of long-term smell loss, and for patients with distorted smells (parosmia), the medication gabapentin has shown some subjective improvement in small studies. 
When to See a Doctor
Most people regain their sense of smell over time, but if the loss is persistent after three to six months, worsens, or causes significant distress (such as severe anxiety or depression), it is important to consult an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist or a dedicated smell and taste clinic. 
Safety Precautions
Losing your sense of smell can pose safety risks. 
Ensure all smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working.
Be diligent about checking food expiration dates and use food thermometers to ensure proper cooking.
