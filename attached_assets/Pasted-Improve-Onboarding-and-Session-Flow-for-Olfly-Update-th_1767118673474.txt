Improve Onboarding and Session Flow for Olfly

Update the Olfly onboarding and training session experience to improve clarity, reduce confusion, and support real-world scent preparation. Add clear preparation instructions, a pre-session setup step, and fix the rest and reset UX so users are not prompted to smell during rest periods.

1. Onboarding: Scent Preparation Screen
Add a New Onboarding Screen

Insert a new onboarding screen titled:

“Prepare your baseline scents”

Purpose

Teach users how to prepare their smell training scents so they are ready and portable.

Content Layout

Title at top

Short explanation paragraph

Visual area that can display a preparation image

Step-by-step instructions

CTA button

Copy to Use

Title:
Prepare your baseline scents

Body text:
To get the most out of smell training, it helps to prepare your scents ahead of time. We recommend starting with four classic scents that are commonly used in smell retraining.

Recommended baseline scents:

Rose

Clove

Lemon

Eucalyptus

How to prepare your scents:

Use small glass jars with lids.

Place a cotton ball inside each jar.

Add a few drops of essential oil to the cotton ball.

Close the lid to keep the scent fresh.

Helpful tip:
Keeping your scents in small containers makes it easy to train anywhere when you get a reminder.

CTA button:
“I’m ready”

Optional secondary link:
“View safety tips”

2. Pre-Session Setup Prompt
Add a Pre-Session Screen Before Training Starts

Before the timer begins, insert a setup screen that pauses the session until the user confirms readiness.

Title

“Get your scents ready”

Copy

Body text:
Before we begin, gather your prepared scents and place them within reach. This helps you stay focused and relaxed during the session.

Checklist UI:

Rose ready

Clove ready

Lemon ready

Eucalyptus ready

Checkboxes optional. A simple confirmation button is sufficient.

Primary button:
“Start session”

Secondary button:
“Need help preparing scents?”

This should link back to the preparation onboarding content.

3. Training Session: Active Smell Phase (No Change Needed)

During active smelling:

Show the scent image

Show timer

Show scent name

Allow intensity rating after the smell interval

No changes needed here.

4. Training Session: Rest and Reset Phase (Critical Fix)
Problem to Fix

Currently the scent image is shown during rest, which confuses users and suggests they should continue smelling.

Required Change

During rest periods:

Remove scent imagery entirely

Replace with a calm resting visual

Shift copy from smelling to breathing and preparation

Rest Screen Content

Visual:
Use a calm illustration or graphic showing a person resting or breathing calmly.

Title:
Rest and reset

Body text:
Take a moment to breathe and let your senses rest.

Guidance text:
Inhale slowly through your nose.
Exhale gently through your mouth.

Next scent prompt:
When you are ready, prepare your next scent: Rose
(Replace Rose dynamically based on session order)

Timer Behavior

Timer continues to count down rest period

No scent image or scent name displayed

Clear transition indicator when next scent begins

5. Session Flow Summary (For Implementation)

Session flow should be:

Pre-session setup screen

Smell phase with scent image and timer

Intensity rating

Rest and reset screen with breathing guidance

Prompt for next scent

Repeat until session complete

6. Accessibility and Clarity Improvements

Use plain language

Avoid medical terms during session flow

Ensure text clearly distinguishes between smelling and resting

Use color or icon changes to visually differentiate:

Smell phase

Rest phase

7. Optional Enhancement (Nice to Have)

Add a toggle in Settings:

“Show breathing guidance during rest”
Default: On

Implementation Notes for Replit

Create separate components for:

PreparationOnboarding

PreSessionSetup

RestPhaseScreen

Use state to control phase visibility

Ensure rest phase never displays scent images

Keep UI consistent with deep purple flat style

Use soft animation transitions between phases

Outcome This Should Achieve

Users understand how to prepare scents before training

Sessions feel calm and intentional

Rest periods are no longer confusing

Users are less likely to rush or misuse scents

Overall trust and usability increases
