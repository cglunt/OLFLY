Implement Functional Reminder System for Olfly

The reminder feature in Olfly is currently non functional. Implement a complete reminder system that requests user permission, schedules reminders, persists settings, and clearly communicates reminder status to the user.

1. Reminder Permission Flow

On first reminder setup or first app launch after onboarding:

Prompt the user with a friendly explanation screen:

Title: “Want a reminder to train?”

Body: “Consistent practice matters. Olfly can remind you when it is time to train.”

Buttons:

“Allow reminders”

“Not now”

When user taps “Allow reminders”:

Request notification permission using the platform appropriate API

Store permission status in app state and local storage

2. Reminder Settings Screen

Create or update a Reminder Settings screen with:

Toggle: “Enable reminders”

Morning reminder time picker

Evening reminder time picker

Preview text under each:

“We will remind you at 8:00 AM”

Status indicator:

Enabled

Disabled

Permission not granted

If permission is denied:

Show guidance:

“Notifications are off. Enable them in your device settings to receive reminders.”

3. Scheduling Logic

When reminders are enabled:

Schedule two daily local notifications

One for morning

One for evening

Use stored times

Notification copy:

Morning: “Time for your smell training. Your scents are waiting.”

Evening: “Quick reset. A few minutes of smell training can help.”

Store reminder settings:

remindersEnabled

morningReminderTime

eveningReminderTime

notificationPermissionStatus

Persist all values in local storage.

4. Reminder Feedback and Confirmation

After user saves reminders:

Show confirmation toast:

“Reminders set. We will take it from here.”

Add a subtle reminder status badge on Home screen:

“Next reminder at 7:30 PM”

5. Guardrails and UX Clarity

Do not show reminder UI if notifications are denied without explanation

Never silently fail

Always reflect actual permission state

Allow user to disable reminders without revoking permission

6. Future Ready Calendar Integration (Do Not Implement Now)

Leave a placeholder comment and feature flag for:

“Sync sessions to calendar”

Do not request calendar permissions yet.

7. Deliverables

Reminder permission prompt

Functional scheduling logic

Persistent reminder settings

Clear user feedback

No fake or inactive reminder UI
