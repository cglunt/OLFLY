You are working in my Replit project for olfly.app (React + TypeScript). I need you to update the main landing page to keep the “For clinicians and care teams” banner, but make the recommended copy and CTA changes.

GOAL
Keep this clinical CTA secondary and opt-in (it must not compete with the main consumer CTA). Update the banner copy and button label, and route it to a clinician access page.

REQUIRED CHANGES (Landing Page)
1) Find the existing banner section that currently displays:
   - Title: “For clinicians and care teams”
   - Subtext: “Support multiple patients with a dashboard, adherence tracking, and exportable progress reports.”
   - Button: “View clinician plans”

2) Update only the copy and CTA:
   - Keep title as: “For clinicians and care teams”
   - Change subtext to:
     “Support patient recovery with a clinician dashboard, adherence tracking, and exportable progress reports.”
   - Change button label to:
     “Request clinician access”
   - Keep the arrow icon if present

3) Keep the banner visually secondary:
   - It should remain below the primary consumer pricing and primary CTAs
   - Do not increase its size
   - Do not make it the highest-contrast element on the page
   - Keep current styling (dark glass card, magenta accent button) but ensure it does not look more prominent than the main “Start free” or consumer plan CTA

ROUTING + PAGE
4) Create a new route and page for clinician access:
   - Route: /clinicians (preferred) or /clinician-access if routing already exists
   - Add a simple clinician access page with:
     - H1: “Clinician access”
     - Subhead: “Get Olfly for your clinic or care team.”
     - A short bullet list of benefits:
       - Clinician dashboard for multiple patients
       - Adherence tracking and progress summaries
       - Exportable PDF reports
     - A simple request form (no backend required):
       - Full name
       - Work email
       - Organization / clinic name
       - Approx patient count (dropdown: 1–10, 11–25, 26–50, 51+)
       - Optional notes
       - Submit button: “Request access”
     - On submit, show an inline success state (no network call):
       “Thanks. We’ll reach out soon.”

5) Update the banner button click to navigate to the clinician access route.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Use existing design system/components if present (Button, Card, Input, etc.).
- If there’s Tailwind, match current classes and spacing.
- If the project uses Wouter:
  - Add a Route for /clinicians
  - Use a Link or navigate() for the CTA button.
- If the project uses React Router:
  - Add a Route for /clinicians
  - Use useNavigate() for the CTA.

FILES
- Make the smallest change set possible.
- Likely files:
  - src/pages/Landing.tsx (or similar)
  - src/App.tsx or src/main.tsx for routes
  - Create: src/pages/Clinicians.tsx (or similar)

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Landing page banner now says “Request clinician access”
- Subtext updated to “Support patient recovery…”
- Clicking CTA takes me to /clinicians
- Clinician page exists with the request form and a local success message
- Banner remains visually secondary and below primary consumer CTAs
