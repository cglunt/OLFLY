You are working in my Replit project for olfly.app (React + TypeScript). I want to simplify pricing at launch based on the final recommendation.

GOAL
Reduce pricing to a clear, low-friction launch setup:
- Consumer: 2 plans only (Free + Plus)
- Clinical: 1 gated plan (Clinic) + Enterprise via contact
- No Premium consumer tier at launch

This should support early growth, organic traffic, and future scaling.

–––––––––––––––––
CONSUMER PRICING (PUBLIC)
–––––––––––––––––

1) Update the main pricing section on the landing page to show ONLY TWO consumer plans.

Plan 1: Free
- Price: $0
- CTA: “Start free”
- Purpose: habit building and belief

Include copy similar to:
- Guided smell training sessions
- Classic four-scent routine
- Daily reminders
- Limited progress view (first 7 days)
- Designed to help you get started and feel early progress

Avoid feature-heavy language. Keep it outcome-focused and lightweight.

Plan 2: Plus
- Price: $6.99 or $7.99 per month (use whichever is easier to configure now)
- Badge: “Most popular”
- CTA: “Upgrade to Plus”

Include:
- Full progress history and charts
- Recovery timeline
- Symptom journal
- Custom scent library
- Exportable personal reports
- Cloud sync

Position Plus as:
“Unlock deeper insight into your recovery over time.”

2) REMOVE the following from consumer pricing:
- Premium plan
- Any 3-tier consumer comparison
- Any feature language implying medical or clinical use

–––––––––––––––––
CLINICAL PRICING (GATED)
–––––––––––––––––

3) Do NOT show clinical pricing as a third column next to consumer plans.

4) Clinical pricing should live on a separate page (/clinicians).

Create ONE visible clinical plan at launch:

Plan name: Clinic
- Price: $79 to $99 per month (pick one value for now)
- CTA: “Request access”

Includes:
- Up to 25 active patients
- Clinician dashboard
- Patient adherence tracking
- Progress summaries
- Exportable PDF reports
- Program templates
- Priority email support

5) Enterprise:
- Do NOT list features in a table
- Show only:
  - Title: “Enterprise”
  - Subtext: “Custom plans for larger organizations and research teams.”
  - CTA: “Contact us”

–––––––––––––––––
COPY + UX RULES
–––––––––––––––––

- Do not mix consumer and clinical language in the same pricing table
- Do not show clinical prices on the consumer landing page
- Use “Request access” instead of “Subscribe” or “Upgrade” for clinicians
- Keep consumer pricing simple enough to choose in under 3 seconds

FILES TO UPDATE / CREATE
–––––––––––––––––

- Update consumer pricing section:
  - src/pages/Landing.tsx (or equivalent)
- Update or create clinician pricing page:
  - src/pages/Clinicians.tsx
- Ensure routing exists:
  - /clinicians

–––––––––––––––––
ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
–––––––––––––––––

- Landing page shows only Free + Plus for consumers
- No Premium consumer tier visible anywhere
- Clinical pricing is gated on /clinicians
- Clinic plan uses “Request access”
- Enterprise is contact-only
- Language focuses on progress and recovery, not features
