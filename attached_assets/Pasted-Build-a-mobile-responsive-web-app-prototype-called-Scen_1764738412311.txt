Build a mobile responsive web app prototype called ScentPath that supports people recovering their sense of smell. Use React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and simple local storage for data persistence. Create the following structure, routes, and components.

Overall Requirements

Clean, calming visual style using soft greens, warm neutrals, and rounded corners.

Mobile first layout with simple navigation tabs at the bottom: Home, Training, Library, Progress, Learn.

Use local storage to save user logs, scent entries, progress, and quiz answers.

Include timers, sliders, charts, and simple animations.

Build placeholder logic for audio guidance and smart alarm integration.

Favor simple, clear components over complexity.

Technical Instructions for Replit

Use React with functional components and hooks

Use Tailwind for styling

Use React Router for navigation

Use local storage or IndexedDB for all saved data

Build chart components using a lightweight library like Chart.js

Create modular components for timers, sliders, scent cards, quiz cards, and infographic blocks

Generate all pages, components, and sample placeholder content so I can interact with the prototype immediately. Use clean and organized file structure.
