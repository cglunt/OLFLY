Replace Achievements With “Progress Updates” + Shareables (No Badges)

In Olfly, the Progress screen currently has an “Achievements” section with badges and “Complete sessions to unlock achievements.” I do not want badges. Replace this entire section with a new feature set called Progress Updates, containing:

Support Statements users can optionally share

Journey Milestones based on time since start (not streaks)

Progress Moments that highlight meaningful moments and improvements

Optional share as an image card (download or share)

Match the existing deep purple flat UI.

1. Remove or Rename “Achievements” Section
Current UI to Change

The “Achievements” title

The locked badge tile (“Next up”)

The purple badge card with “Complete sessions to unlock achievements”

Replace With

A new section titled: Progress Updates

Subtext:
“Gentle check ins to help you notice progress over time.”

2. Add Three Subsections Under “Progress Updates”
A) Support Statements (Shareable)

Create a horizontal carousel or stacked cards with short affirmations.

Title: “Support statements”
Subtitle: “Save one that fits today.”

Examples (include these at minimum):

“Healing is not linear.”

“Small signals matter.”

“Consistency over perfection.”

“Progress can be quiet.”

“Showing up counts.”

Each card should have:

The statement text

Two actions:

“Save” (adds to favorites)

“Share” (opens share modal)

Persist favorites in local storage:

olflyFavoriteStatements: string[]

B) Journey Milestones (Time Based)

Create a milestones block that shows time since the user started smell training.

You need a startDate for the user:

If you already have one, use it

If not, set it the first time they complete a session:

olflyStartDate = ISO timestamp

Display milestones as soft chips or a vertical list.

Milestones:

“7 days since you started”

“30 days since you started”

“3 months into your recovery journey”

“6 months into your recovery journey”

“1 year since you started”

Rules:

These should unlock automatically based on today minus startDate.

Do not show as locked badges.

If not reached, show as “Upcoming” in muted text.

Add a share button:

“Share milestone”

C) Progress Moments (Meaningful Moments, Not Streaks)

Create a block that surfaces meaningful moments based on user logs.

Title: “Progress moments”
Subtitle: “Small changes you might miss.”

Moments can be generated from:

Session completion data

Intensity ratings

Notes (optional)

Implement at least these moment types:

First notice moment (manual):

After rating a scent above 0 for the first time, show:
“First time noticing {scent} again.”

Improvement this month (computed):

Compare average intensity for last 30 days vs previous 30 days:
“Smell clarity increased by {X}% this month.”
If no previous data:
“This month you built your baseline.”

Scent specific highlight (computed):

Find which scent increased most in the last 30 days:
“{Scent} improved the most this month.”

Consistency without streaks:

Based on sessions completed in last 7 or 30 days:
“Consistency is paying off. You practiced {N} times this month.”

Each moment should show:

Title line (the moment)

Small supporting line: “Based on your recent sessions”

Share button

Persist generated moments:

olflyProgressMoments with fields:

id

type

title

detail

createdAt

dataSnapshot (optional)

3. Share Card Generator (Optional but Recommended)

Implement a share modal that generates a square social image (1080x1080) for:

Support statement

Journey milestone

Progress moment

Design requirements:

Background #1A0F35

Card surface #2B215B

Accent gradient #DF37FF to #A259FF

Large headline text (the statement or moment)

Small footer text:
“Olfly • Wake up your super sniffer.”

Implement export:

Use html-to-image or dom-to-image to create PNG

Provide actions:

Download image

Share using Web Share API if available
Fallback to download only.

Do not auto-post. Users choose.

4. Data and Calculation Requirements
Start Date

Set olflyStartDate on first completed session if missing.

Monthly intensity change

Calculate avg intensity for last 30 days

Calculate avg intensity for previous 30 days

Percent change:
((current - previous) / max(previous, 1)) * 100
If previous is 0 or no data:

show baseline message instead of percent.

“First noticing again”

Trigger when:

user rates a scent above 0 AND previously that scent was always 0 or no entries

5. Update the Existing Progress Screen Layout

Current sections include:

“Overview Weekly Analysis” card

“Achievements” section

“Avg Intensity” and empty chart

Update layout to:

Overview card stays

Replace Achievements with Progress Updates

Keep Avg Intensity and chart below

Add a small empty state improvement:

If no sessions yet:
Show support statements anyway and a gentle prompt:
“Start your first session to see progress moments.”

6. UX Copy Updates

Replace any badge language with supportive language:

Remove: “unlock achievements”, “your first badge awaits”

Use:

“Notice progress over time”

“Small signals matter”

“You are building your baseline”

7. Deliverables

Removed badge based Achievements UI

New “Progress Updates” section with:

Support Statements (favorite + share)

Journey Milestones (time-based + share)

Progress Moments (generated insights + share)

Optional share image export feature

Local storage persistence for favorites, start date, moments

Extra: Quick Design Notes for the UI You Shared

The “Achievements” header area can remain in the same position, just rename it and swap components.

The locked badge tile should become a “Support statement” card instead.

The large purple unlock card becomes the “Progress moments” container with a calm empty state.
