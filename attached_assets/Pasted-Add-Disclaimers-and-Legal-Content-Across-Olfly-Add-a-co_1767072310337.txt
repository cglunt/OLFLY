Add Disclaimers and Legal Content Across Olfly

Add a complete “Legal and Disclaimers” system to the Olfly app. Implement both short and full versions of disclaimers, and place them in specific parts of the user experience so they are visible, accessible, and not disruptive.

Use React, React Router, Tailwind, and local storage. Create new routes, components, and UI patterns. Add acceptance tracking.

Goals

Users see a short medical disclaimer during onboarding and at first app use.

Users can access full legal documents anytime from Settings.

Product recommendation screens show affiliate disclosure inline.

Essential oil safety guidance is included in Learn and as a contextual note inside Training.

No guarantee, emergency, and responsibility disclaimers exist in Terms and in key places.

Store user acceptance of terms in local storage with timestamp and version.

1. Create New Routes

Add the following routes:

/legal (Legal hub page)

/legal/terms (Terms of Use)

/legal/privacy (Privacy Policy)

/legal/disclaimers (Disclaimers page)

/legal/affiliate (Affiliate Disclosure)

/legal/safety (Essential Oil Safety)

Add links to these pages from Settings.

2. Add a “Legal” Section in Settings

In the Settings screen, create a “Legal” section with list items:

Terms of Use

Privacy Policy

Medical Disclaimer

Affiliate Disclosure

Essential Oil Safety

Contact and Support

Each item navigates to its respective page.

Also show:

“Terms accepted: Yes or No”

“Accepted on: date”

“Version: v1.0”

Add a “Review terms” button.

3. Add Onboarding Disclaimer Screen and Acceptance

In onboarding, add a screen near the end titled:

Title: “Quick note before you begin”
Body: short, friendly disclaimer summary.
Include a checkbox:

“I understand Olfly is for educational and wellness support only and not medical advice.”

Buttons:

Primary: “I agree and continue”

Secondary: “View full terms”

Rules:

Users cannot continue unless they check the box.

Save acceptance in local storage with:

termsAccepted: true

termsAcceptedAt: ISO timestamp

termsVersion: "1.0"

If termsAccepted is false, redirect them to onboarding or the disclaimer screen.

4. Add a First Run Interstitial if Needed

If an existing user bypasses onboarding or loads the app directly:

Show a modal interstitial on app load:

Title: “Before you start”

Short disclaimer

Button: “Review and accept”

Link: “View full terms”
This should only appear if termsAccepted is not true.

5. Add Contextual Disclaimers in Specific App Areas
Training Session Screen

Add a small collapsible info link under the session controls:

Label: “Safety note”
When expanded, show essential oil safety guidance in short form.

Learn Screen

In the Learn section, add a “Safety” card linking to /legal/safety.

Product Recommendations Screen

At the top of the recommended products page, add affiliate disclosure text:

“Some links are affiliate links. We may earn a small commission at no cost to you.”

Make it visually subtle but obvious.

Export Screen or Clinician Export Button

Add a short disclaimer near export:

“This report is informational and not a medical record.”
